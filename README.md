# CODTECH Internship – Task 2: Predictive Modeling (Titanic Dataset)

## ✅ Overview
In Task 2 of my Data Analysis Internship at CODTECH, I built a classification model using **PySpark** and **Scikit-learn** to predict survival outcomes based on Titanic dataset features.

The notebook demonstrates:
- Feature selection & preprocessing
- Model training with Random Forest
- Evaluation using accuracy and classification metrics

---

## 🔍 Dataset
- Dataset: Titanic (via seaborn)
- Target: `survived` (1 = survived, 0 = not survived)

---

## 📁 Files Included
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `TitanicPrediction.ipynb` | Notebook with complete code |
| `titanic_predictions.csv` | Output predictions (test set) |

---

## 🧠 Key Techniques
- Data cleaning and encoding
- Train-test split (80/20)
- Random Forest classification
- Confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score

---

## 🚀 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Google Colab
